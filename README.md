# school parent communication system 


We are proposing a web based system that servs as a bridge between students parents and the school. It notifies about info from the school to the parents. And if parents have somthing to contact the school they can also contact the school using the same system.

As a parent i need to see my kids grades as soon they are out.

As a parent i need to contact the school immediately when ever i want some thing.

As a teacher i need to notify the parents of the students on the progress of the student.
